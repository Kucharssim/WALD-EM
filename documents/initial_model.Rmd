Here, we will provide some more information about the initial model reported in the article. Specifically, here we explain the basic of the model's architecture, and describe additional information.

## The model

The model contains four factors (components), of which two are included in the model for *when.* The factors are the following:

1. Objects in the scene (included in the model for when)
2. Saliency of the images (included in the model for when)
3. Exploitation
4. Central bias


## Simulation

We conducted a small parameter recovery simulation to assess the model's performance. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(imager)
library(plotrix)
library(gtools)
library(rstan)
library(here)
source(here::here("R", "load_image.R"))
source(here::here("R", "helpers.R"))
```
