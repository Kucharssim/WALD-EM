Here, we will provide some more information about the initial model
reported in the article. Specifically, here we explain the basic of the
model’s architecture, and describe additional information.

## The model

The model contains four factors (components), of which two are included
in the model for *when.* The factors are the following:

1.  Objects in the scene (included in the model for when)
2.  Saliency of the images (included in the model for when)
3.  Exploitation
4.  Central bias

## Simulation

We conducted a small parameter recovery simulation to assess the model’s
performance.
