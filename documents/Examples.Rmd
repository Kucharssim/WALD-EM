This file serves as a supplement to the article "Dynamic models of eye movements" and provides step by step explanation of the building and implementation of the modelling framework of the joint distribution of fixation locations and fixation durations.

In this folder, there are additional files that go through specific examples of the model. These examples should provide some guidance in building and implementing such a model. The models are implemented in Stan [@carpenter2017stan] in combination with the R package rstan [@team2016rstan].

# Principled Bayesian modeling

Here, we summarise several criteria and approaches we used for validating our model, following general reccomendations for Bayesian modeling, see @schad2019principled.

## Prior predictives

Each of the models is parametrized with several parameters, some of which do, and other do not have clear physical interpretation. 

## Computational faithfullness

We check whether the Bayesian inference for the implemented model is self consistent, i.e., whether the Bayesian updating of the prior leads to correct posteriors. We check that by conducting simulation-based calibration [@talts2018sbc].

## Model sensitivity

We also investigate whether and to what extend are the estimates of the paramaters biased, and to what extend are data informative to specific parameters. To do this, we plot the posterior z-scores and posterior contraction against each other for all focal parameters in the model.
